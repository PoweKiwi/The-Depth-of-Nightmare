# The-Depth-of-Nightmare

A rogue-like game with RPG turn-based battle.  Basically, go into the depth of the dungeon to retrieve a precious treasure from a dangerous creature, called the Nitemare.  You pick up gold pieces and items to help you along with your journey. You level up from defeated enemies.  If you go deep enough, you'll come to a choice to either fight Nitemare, or pick a random floor to level up on.  Which is which?  You'll find out.

Pick a difficulty to start the game.  Easy have a fixed depth pattern and starts you off with a wooden stick and some clothes while hard starts you off naked and the depth pattern is random after the first floor.  So you may face a hard guardian on depth 2.  Good luck!

During the game, you can bring up the menu by pressing B.  From there, you can pick Check Bag or Status.  Check bag, you can pick an item, and pick whether to use them or drop them.  You can use this oppuntity to remove or use item to make room to pick up another item that may be better than the one you had.  You can only hold 6 items at a time.  Chose wisely.  If you attempt to put an item into your full bag, the item in your hand will be destroyed.  

There are 4 different food items, herb, bread, meat, and potion.  Herb heals the least, while the potion heal you the most.  Most food item comes in bags.  However, check your bag to see if you have space.  Otherwise, the bag you picked up will implode and allow you to pass through.  All food item will cure poison status.  Occasionally, the bag will contain gold pieces.  

Picking up meat will allow you to either eat it or put it in your bag, if it isn't full that is.  

Chest only gives you random amount of gold.  

Traps, they are random.  There are traps that rain gold upon the victim,  Ouch.  And other can poison you, which a skull symbol will appear on the upper left corner.  Sometimes, the enemy screwed up and put a trap that heals you.

There are 6 scrolls and it is recommend to save them for hard enemies.

Fire Scroll - Does half the enemies' HP, with minimum 20 HP of damage.  
Ice Scroll - Does 10 damage, but freeze your enemy until it thaw itself out.
Acid Scroll - Does 5 HP of damage but destroy your enemies' defense.
Life Scroll - Heals you completely.  It'll also be used automatically when your HP reach 0 in battle(Not in traps).
Pow Scroll - Greatly increase your attack and defense power by 40.
Toxic Scroll - Does 10 damage and poison your enemy

Shops - You trade in your equipment along with the gold to cover the cost for a new equipment.  If you only have 100 gold and the equipment you wanted is 140 gold. You have on a equipment that's worth 50 gold, then you can trade that in and buy that equipment with 10 gold left over.  The gold total +Weapon or +Armor, so might need to do some math in your head to buy equipment in this game.  The shopkeeper spray the equipment with cleaning product for the next victim to buy.  Um, forget that last sentence.

INN - Stay once and then the shop disappear.  

Keys - There should be enough keys to complete a floor. You could collect more keys from ? box to unlock the treasure room, if you're lucky.  

Blob symbol are the easy enemies.  So I recommend defeating them to tackle the harder enemies.

You have the standing monster symbol, which are the harder enemies.  

Then the one that holds an axe are the Staircase Guardian.  They are assigned to a specific map.

A new monster for the easy and hard is introduced per floor you go down.   By depth 9, you'll see them all. 

Hopefully you all enjoy this game.  This game is made by Kiwi.
